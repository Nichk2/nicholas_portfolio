    "overview": "The P3M Platform is a Brazilian governmental tool that provides information and knowledge about the mining process to improve business decisions in the sector and promote regional development.",
    "problem": "Our stakeholders wanted to implement several changes on the platform's design, especially from ideas that they managed to gather from other platforms with the same service. Those platforms provide those same services differently, however, with a greater level of usability (according with the stakeholders). Taking into account that context, they decided to change the platform adding some features trying to use the maximum as possible what was developed earlier, thus changing the design partially not totally.",
    "goal": "We have decided to implement new elements and features to the platform but trying to respect great part of the design of P3M. In order to do so, we conducted research other platforms that have the same objective like SARIG from Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, Jazida from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and SIGEOM from Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.",

    "originalScreensDescription": "The image above shows the original design of the P3M Platform. The team responsible for the platform wanted to change some features and add new ones, but they wanted to keep the original design as much as possible.",
    "layersDescription": "The image above shows the changes applied by our team during the project. We made an treeview at the Layers section, moved some features to it, and we built a better navigation flow at the top of the treeview. The menu that contains action icons at the right of the treeview did not receive changes due the client's orientation.",
    "commodityCards": "Commodity Cards Redesign",
    "commodityDescription": "The image above shows the changes applied on the elements cards. We made separated section and divided into \"Principais Commodities\" translated to english â†’ \"Main Commodities\". We applied a lighter background, alterations on the cards design with addition of more colors for each commodity in order to increase more positive energy to the platform and externalize differences among the commodities.",
    "menuSimplification": "Menu Simplification",
    "menuDescription": "Another basic change that is crucial to mention is the relocation the team did with some icons from the older bottom menu and add \"Institucional\" section for the user as the image above shows. In order to improve and facilitate the user's flow and decision making, the idea of turning the bottom menu simpler by relocating elements to the treeview caught the client's attention. LESS, sometimes, is a PLUS.",
    "newDashboard": "New Dashboard Sections",
    "dashboardDescription": "Both of the images above shows a new addition we had the freedom to show to the client. They are sections with some dashboards and cards. The first image is a detailed screen of a specific element (Gold in this case) and the other is about a specific study of a region in Brazil. We chose to use cards and play with some formats to add more dynamism, and we used soft colors to maintain cleanness.",
    "quickSearch": "Quick Search Redesign",
    "quickSearchBefore": "Another important alteration was the \"Busca RÃ¡pida\" - translated to english \"Quick Search\" - actions and design. While this one (the older) was a little bit disconnected with the platform according with the client, we worked on a new one in order to promote more connection with the platform. You can see in the next image.",
    "quickSearchAfter": "We added two buttons, one for general search - the first one from the left to right - and another button that will open the modal of the second image.",
    "finalHomepage": "Final Homepage Redesign",
    "finalDescription": "The \"Home\" of the first version was limited to show only the cards of \"Conhecimento GeocientÃ­fico\"- translated to english \"Geoscientific Knowledge\" - this one was relocated for the small section called \"Explorar mapa por categoria\" - translated to english \"Explore map by category\" - the team thought that would be interesting to make a separated section and inserted \"Principais Commodities\" at the beginning, since the client wanted to highlight it for the user. The image above is the result of our work.",
    "results": "Results",
    "resultsText": "According to the team responsible for requesting our work, many at the institution approved our design and felt a significant improvement in the user experience. Our redesign also facilitated the new implementations that are to come on the new platform."
