      "AwesomeGames is a game library app where all users can interact with each other through a game community. In the app the users are able to navigate through many game categories, save games into their libraries so they can read more about the game and play it later (on another platform). They are also able to interact with other gamers in communities by chat and lives that the app opens to them.",

    "keyTakeaways": [
      "AwesomeGames has made an attempt to meet users' necessity to receive simplicity in a preview game app. The idea is to create a simple space where gamers could interact with each other, store their game previews so they can share with other players through the community available, watch lives and also share their live sessions with each other. one of the participants said, \"This is a really good idea, I love to play games, and I loved how the design was made to make navigation simple and fun! The way how we can add game previews to our libraries is also very easy. Nice app\"",
      "Some of the participants did not express excitement with the idea of the game preview existence, however, they thought that with the rising of the new generation of gamers and their great community, this could work with some upgrades like improvements of navigation and changing of the design to something with smoother colors. Further changes and tests are required.",
      "This project that I started since the beginning of the UX design google course was vital for me to understand processes of UX research and its methods and also helped me to optimize my design skills. It was a great experience to practice empathy and understanding what users really need."
